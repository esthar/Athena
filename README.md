Athena
======

 This program is the firmware for the Athena Computer, one of the flight computers on board the payload of the Electronics Club's high altitude balloon project, codename Daedalus.
 Athena's purposes are: collecting data from sensor; translating this data into appropriate message formats for radio and SMS transmission; sending SMS texts following certain events; sending radio messages to ground relayed by the Hermes computer; generating status flags and communicating these to Hermes.
